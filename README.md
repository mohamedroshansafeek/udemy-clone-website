### 📝 **Project Title:**

**Udemy Clone – Responsive Learning Platform UI (HTML & CSS Only)**

### 📄 **Description:**

I created a **responsive clone of the Udemy homepage** using only **HTML and CSS**, aiming to replicate the look and feel of a real online learning platform.

This project includes:

* ✅ A **modern navbar** with logo, search bar, and action buttons
* 🎯 A **hero section** with a promotional banner, headline, and search input
* 📚 A **course showcase** with visually structured cards using CSS Flexbox
* 🧭 A static **categories section** mimicking Udemy’s horizontal sliders
* 💼 A **business promotion section** encouraging team learning
* 📱 Fully **mobile-responsive design** with media queries
* 💡 Clean, semantic HTML with reusable CSS components
* ✨ Basic animations and hover effects to improve interactivity

### 🚀 Purpose:

This clone was built to strengthen my skills in **HTML structure**, **CSS layout (Flexbox)**, and **responsive web design**, all without using any JavaScript.
